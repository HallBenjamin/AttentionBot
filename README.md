# Attention! Bot for Discord
### Written using Discord.Net 1.0.2 and Microsoft.Net Framework 4.5.2
"Attention to the designated grid square! (E3)" for Discord (from War ThunderÂ®, quite annoying when spammed but fun to spam). Do not compile and run (it's on a server, and you don't have the token).

##### Note: This bot is constantly evolving. With 2 commands and just under 100 lines of code when first created, it now has 16 commands (9 for the public) with over 600 lines of code.

Add this bot to your server! https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=346064990152818690&scope=bot&permissions=220160

Prefix: \

Commands:

- \help 3949
  - Lists available commands

- \changelog 3949
