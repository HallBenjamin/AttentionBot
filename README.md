# Attention! Bot for Discord
### Written using Discord.Net 1.0.1 and Microsoft.Net Framework 4.6.1
"Attention to the designated grid square! (E3)" for Discord (from War ThunderÂ®, quite annoying when spammed but fun to spam). Do not compile and run (it's on a server, and you don't have the token).

Add this bot to your server! https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=346064990152818690&scope=bot&permissions=203776

Prefix: \

Commands:
- \help 3949

  - Lists available commands

- \announce [channel id]

  - SERVER OWNER ONLY! Sets the Channel with the specified ID as the channel for bot announcements. Channel ID is mandatory.

- \attention [position]

  - Position is one letter A-J (capitalization does not matter) and/or one number 1-9. Order does not matter. Position is not required for the command.
