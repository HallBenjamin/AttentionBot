# AttentionBot
Attention to the designated grid square! (E3) for Discord (from War Thunder, quite annoying). Do not compile and run (it's on a server, and you don't have the token).

Prefix: \

Commands:
- \help 3949
- \attention [position]

Position is one letter A-J (capitalization does not matter) and/or one number 1-9. Order does not matter.
