# Attention! Bot for Discord
### Written using Discord.Net 1.0.1 and Microsoft.Net Framework 4.6.1
"Attention to the designated grid square! (E3)" for Discord (from War ThunderÂ®, quite annoying when spammed but fun to spam). Do not compile and run (it's on a server, and you don't have the token).

##### Note: This bot is constantly evolving. With 2 commands and just under 100 lines of code when first created, it now has 8 commands (4 for the public) with 450 lines of code.
