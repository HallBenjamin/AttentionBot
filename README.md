# Attention! Bot for Discord
### Written using Discord.Net 1.0.2 and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.1
"Attention to the designated grid square! (E3)" for Discord (from War ThunderÂ®, quite annoying when spammed but fun to spam). Do not compile and run (it's on a server, and you don't have the token).

##### Note: This bot is constantly evolving. With 2 commands and just under 100 lines of code when first created, it now has 19 commands (12 for the public) and almost 1,000 lines of code.

Add this bot to your server! https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=346064990152818690&scope=bot&permissions=220160
