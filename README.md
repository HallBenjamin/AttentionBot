# Attention! Bot for Discord
### Written using Discord.Net 1.0.2 and Microsoft.Net Framework 4.6.1
"Attention to the designated grid square! (E3)" for Discord (from War ThunderÂ®, quite annoying when spammed but fun to spam). Do not compile and run (it's on a server, and you don't have the token).

##### Note: This bot is constantly evolving. With 2 commands and just under 100 lines of code when first created, it now has 9 commands (5 for the public) with 450 lines of code.

Add this bot to your server! https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=346064990152818690&scope=bot&permissions=104012800

Prefix: \

Commands:
- \help 3949

  - Lists available commands

- \admin [role id]

  - SERVER OWNER ONLY! Sets the specified role as an administrative role for the bot's admin commands.

- \mentions [0/1]

  - ADMINS AND SERVER OWNERS ONLY! Enables (1) or disables (0) user mentions for the bot.

- \announce [channel id]

  - ADMINS AND SERVER OWNER ONLY! Sets the Channel with the specified ID as the channel for bot announcements. Channel ID is mandatory.

- \attention [position] [user ID]

  - Position is one letter A-J (capitalization does not matter) and/or one number 1-10. Order does not matter. Position is not required for the command.
  
  - User ID only works if \mentions is set to 1 and if a position is given. Set the User ID to the ID of the user you want the bot to mention. User ID is optional.
